mutation_chromatin
==================
This scripts takes mutation data (bed files) and calculates the p-value of enrichment and repression of mutations in different chromatin region (specifically 'chromatin color regions') using a chi square test. 
Then it plots a heatmap using the enrichment (green) and repression (red) p-values.
